            The datasets are obtained official datasets provided by <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/alternative-learning-system/resources/facts-and-figures/datasets/" target="_blank">DepEd (Local Source)</a>  and <a href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/#" target="_blank">UNESCO UIS (Global Source).</a>

        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>There are two datasets provided by DepEd which are necessary for the study: number of teachers by school year and enrollment data by school year. The amount of teachers are sub grouped by region and by the level of education they teach: <span class="bold-text">Elementary, Junior High School, and Senior High School</span>. Enrollment data on the other hand, are grouped by region, birth sex, and grade level.</p>
            <p>Due to the scope of the study, the enrollment data only focuses on public school students, as the DepEd can only disclose the amount of public school teachers.

        <div class="res-title"> UNESCO UIS Data (Global Source)</div>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>The UNESCO UIS Data also presents both number of teachers by year and enrollment data per year.

        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p> Before combining the two major datasets, it was necessary to set a definition that Primary (Elementary), Lower Secondary (Junior High School), and Upper Secondary (Senior High School) for brevity.</p>
            <p> For the scope of the school years, the team selected 2017 to 2021. This is the latest data presented by DepEd and the earliest year where the Philippines implemented Senior High School (S.Y. 2016-2017).</p>
            <p> To obtain the averages, most of the data were summed up by school year and divide the number of enrollees over the number of teachers. For the UNESCO UIS dataset, this was done individually for each country. However, due to the large size of this dataset some countries were removed due to inconsistency, that is when the data for the country's enrollment is present but the number of teachers is not, and vice versa. </p>

        <div class="res-title">Interpretation</div>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>	With the T-test results and acceptance/rejection of the hypotheses, we obtain insight for the different research questions. For the primary research question, it can be seen that the average student-teacher ratio (of all levels) of the Philippines is significantly higher compared to the global average. In other words, classrooms in the Philippines are more likely to feature a large number of students in a single section or class.</p>
            <p> As for the secondary research questions, we can see that the same can be said for the lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education, with the upper-secondary ratio showing a more concerning difference hinted by it having the highest T-value and lowest p-value. Among the three levels of education, only the primary level bears no significant difference when compared to its global average counterpart. </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="res-title">Relevance to research questions and potential impacts on the Philippines</div>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p> With this information, we can imply that teachers in the Philippines are stretched thinly with more students to juggle which affects their ability to cater to all of their students’ individual needs and, equally important, their own needs and well-being. </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="res-title">Address limitations</div>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p> Missing data – In certain “year” categories, some countries had no data/missing data. To overcome this the research instead focused on continental averages instead of averages per country.</p>
            <p> Formatting consistency – With the mentioned missing data, in order to crunch all the numbers, new data sets were formed to handle missing values and to make the coding process easier.</p>
            <p> Dealing with outliers – Given the nature of the research topic/question, there are little to no outliers (since this topic covers ratios and averages of large samples instead of individual samples) so “outliers”, if any, were left as is. </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p> Teachers in the Philippines, except for primary-level teachers, handle more students than normal. This greatly adds challenge to an already difficult job as they would have to manage larger records, guide more pupils, check more tests, etc… The added workload can potentially negatively affect the teacher’s well-being, and if a teacher cannot teach properly, students cannot learn properly. </p>

I've personally been part of 40+ student classes so I'm glad to have the opportunity to dig deeper about this topic using the math and programming skills I have honed throughout my studies.</p>
                <p>In stark contrast to the heavy math and programming in my course, I have a deep passion for art, both digital and traditional. I also love getting into the details and analyzing all forms of art, especially movies, music, and other forms of media.</p>
